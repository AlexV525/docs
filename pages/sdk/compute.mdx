# Spheron Compute SDK

The Spheron Compute SDK is a npm package that provides support for working with Spheron Compute organizations.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The package is only meant for Node.js environments and will not work
  in a browser or frontend apps.
</Callout>

## Installation

**Using NPM**

```
npm i @spheron/compute
```

**Using Yarn**

```
yarn add @spheron/compute
```

## Usage

To use the Spheron Compute SDK, you have to create an instance of `SpheronClient`.

```js
import { SpheronClient } from "@spheron/compute";

const spheron = new SpheronClient({ token });
```

The `SpheronClient` constructor takes an object that has one property `token`.
Follow the instructions in the [DOCS](https://docs.spheron.network/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token) to generate this token. When you are creating the tokens, please choose **Compute** type in the dashboard.
The `SpheronClient` has five properties:

- `organization` provides methods for working with the organization.
- `cluster` provides methods for working with cluster.
- `instance` provides methods for working with specific instance.
- `computeMarketplace` provides methods for getting information about marketplace apps.
- `computeMachine` provides methods for getting information about available compute machines.

## Organization

The methods for working with the organization are available on the `organization` property of the `SpheronClient` object.

### get

Used to get the organization based on the passed id.

```js
const organization: Organization = await spheron.organization.get();
```

Returns an Organization object.

```js
interface Organization {
  id: string;
  profile: {
    name: string,
    username: string,
    image: string,
  };
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** At the moment, Spheron Tokens are scoped to a single organization.
  So you can only use them to get information about the organization for which
  you have created the token.
</Callout>

---

### getClusters

Used to get the clusters of the organization. The method supports pagination.

```js
const clusters: Cluster[] = await spheron.organization.getClusters({

```

Params:

- `options`
  - `skip` (number) - number of clusters to skip.
