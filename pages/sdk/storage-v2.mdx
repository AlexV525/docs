# Storage SDK

<Callout type="info">
  This is the documentation for `@spheron/storage` SDK versions `>=2.0.0`. 
  
  The `@spheron/storage` SDK `>=2.0.0` requires a token for a Storage organization, and all the usages are bound to the provided organization.
  
  If you have been using the SDK `<2.0.0` versions with the Static Site organization and wish to migrate your existing buckets to a new Storage organization to take advantage of the latest features and improvements, we have provided a convenient method for this purpose.

- To migrate the buckets of your Static Site organization to your new Storage organization, please refer to the [migrateStaticSiteOrgToStorage](/sdk/storage-v2/#migrate-buckets-from-static-site-organization) method in our documentation. By following the migration process, you can seamlessly transition to the latest version of the SDK and leverage the enhanced features it offers while maintaining your existing data.

- In the following [section](/sdk/storage-v2/#changes-between-200-and-200) you can checkout the changes between `<2.0.0` and `>=2.0.0`.

</Callout>

The Spheron Storage SDK is equipped with multi-chain storage capabilities powered by Spheron.

<Callout type="warning">
  The package is only meant for Node.js environments and will not work in a
  browser or frontend apps.
</Callout>

## Installation

**Using NPM**

```
npm i @spheron/storage
```

**Using Yarn**

```
yarn add @spheron/storage
```

## Usage

To use the Spheron Storage SDK, you have to create an instance of `SpheronClient`.

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

const client = new SpheronClient({ token });
```

The `SpheronClient` constructor takes an object that has one property `token`.
Follow the instructions in the [DOCS](https://docs.spheron.network/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token) to generate this token.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** When you are creating the tokens, please choose **Storage** type in
  the dashboard.
</Callout>

The `SpheronClient` instance provides several methods for working with buckets. Here's the list of all the supported methods.

### Upload

#### Upload

Used to upload a file/directory to the specified protocol.

```js
let currentlyUploaded = 0;

const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks, cid } =
  await client.upload(filePath, {
    protocol: ProtocolEnum.IPFS,
    name,
    onUploadInitiated: (uploadId) => {
      console.log(`Upload with id ${uploadId} started...`);
    },
    onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
      currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
      console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
    },
  });
```

Function `upload` takes two parameters:

- **filePath** - (string) - The path to the file/directory that will be uploaded.
- **configuration:** An object with the following parameters:
  1.  `configuration.name`
      - Represents the name of the bucket on which you are uploading the data.
  2.  `configuration.protocol`
      - The protocol on which the data will be uploaded. The supported protocols are [ `ARWEAVE`, `IPFS`, `FILECOIN`].
  3.  `configuration.onUploadInitiated` **(Optional)**
      - Callback function `(uploadId: string) => void`. The function will be called once, when the upload is initiated, right before the data is uploaded. The function will be called with one parameter, `uploadId`, which represents the id of the started upload.
  4.  `configuration.onChunkUploaded` **(Optional)**
      - Callback function `(uploadedSize: number, totalSize: number) => void`. The function will be called multiple times, depending on the upload size. The function will be called each time a chunk is uploaded, with two parameters. The first one `uploadedSize` represents, the size in Bytes for the uploaded chunk. The `totalSize` represents the total size of the upload in Bytes.

**Response**

```js
interface UploadRes {
  uploadId: string;
  bucketId: string;
  protocolLink: string;
  dynamicLinks: Domain[];
  cid: string;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The CID property will only have value for IPFS and Filecoin uploads.
</Callout>

---

#### Encrypt Upload

Used to encrypt a string or a file and upload it to IPFS.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Both the `encryptUpload` functions require an instance of
  LitNodeClient that is already connected. To create an instance, checkout the
  [@lit-protocol/lit-node-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-protocol/lit-node-client)
  package or our
  [example](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/storage-encryption/src/encrypt.js)

    chain,
    filePath,
    litNodeClient: client,
    configuration: {
      name: bucketName,
    },
  });
```

Parameters of `encryptUpload`:

- **handshake-domain**: you should create a **A** type record with the value `ipfs.namebase.io` and `@` for name. Also, you should create a **TXT** type record with the `link` for a value and `_contenthash` for a name.
- **handshake-subdomain**: you should create a **A** type record with the value `ipfs.namebase.io` and the same name as the domain you have added. Also, you should create a **TXT** type record with the `link` for a value and `_contenthash.<name_of_the_domain>` for a name.
- **ens-domain**: you should create a **CONTENT** type record with the `link` for a value and the same name as the domain you have added.

```js
const bucketDomain: Domain = await client.addBucketDomain(bucketId, {
  link,
  type,
  name,
});
```

Function `addBucketDomain` takes two parameters:

- **bucketId** - (string) - The id of the bucket.
- **bucketDetails** - An object with the link, type, and name of the bucket to be added.

After you have setup the record on your DNS provider, then you should call the `verifyBucketDomain` method to verify your domain on Spheron. After the domain is verified, the data behind the link will be cached on the Spheron CDN.

**Response**

```js
enum DomainTypeEnum {
  DOMAIN = "domain",
  SUBDOMAIN = "subdomain",
  HANDSHAKE_DOMAIN = "handshake-domain",
  HANDSHAKE_SUBDOMAIN = "handshake-subdomain",
  ENS_DOMAIN = "ens-domain",
}

interface Domain {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  link: string;
  verified: boolean;
  bucketId: string;
  type: DomainTypeEnum;
}
```

  bucketId,
  domainIdentifier
);
```

Function `verifyBucketDomain` takes two parameters:

- **bucketId** - (string) - The id of the bucket.
- **domainIdentifier** - (string) - It can either be the id of the domain or the name of the domain.

**Response**

```js
enum DomainTypeEnum {
  DOMAIN = "domain",
  SUBDOMAIN = "subdomain",
  HANDSHAKE_DOMAIN = "handshake-domain",
  HANDSHAKE_SUBDOMAIN = "handshake-subdomain",
  ENS_DOMAIN = "ens-domain",
}

interface Domain {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  link: string;
  verified: boolean;
  bucketId: string;
  type: DomainTypeEnum;
}
```

#### Update Bucket Domain

Used to update an existing domain of the Bucket.

```js
const bucketDomain: Domain = await client.updateBucketDomain(
  bucketId,
  domainIdentifier,
  {
    link,
    name,
  }
);
```

Function `updateBucketDomain` takes three parameters:

- **bucketId** - (string) - The id of the bucket.
- **domainIdentifier** - (string) - It can either be the id of the domain or the name of the domain.
- **options** - An object with the link and name of the bucket to be updated.

**Response**

```js
enum DomainTypeEnum {
  DOMAIN = "domain",
  SUBDOMAIN = "subdomain",
  HANDSHAKE_DOMAIN = "handshake-domain",
  HANDSHAKE_SUBDOMAIN = "handshake-subdomain",
  ENS_DOMAIN = "ens-domain",
}

interface Domain {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  link: string;
  verified: boolean;
  bucketId: string;
  type: DomainTypeEnum;
}
```

#### Get CDN DNS Records

Used to get the values that should be set on your DNS provider for your bucket domains.

```js
const { cdnARecords, cdnCnameRecords } = await client.getCdnDnsRecords();
```

Function `getCdnDnsRecords` doesn't take any parameters.

**Response**

- **cdnARecords** - (string) - will contain the DNS value that should be used for domains.
- **cdnCnameRecords** - (string) - will contain the DNS value that should be used for subdomains.

### Get Token Scope

Used to get the scope of the token.

```js
const tokenScope: TokenScope = await client.getTokenScope();
```

Function `getTokenScope` takes no parameters.

**Response**

```js
interface TokenScope {
  user: {

## Storage Utility

### Transforming CID from V0 to V1 and vice versa

The package also provides a couple of methods for transforming CID from V0 to V1 and vice verse.

```js
import { ipfs } from "@spheron/storage";

const cid = <CID_VALUE>;

const v1 = ipfs.utils.toV1(cid);
console.log("CID V1", v1);

const v0 = ipfs.utils.toV0(cid);
console.log("CID V0", v0);

```

## Changes between `<2.0.0` and `>=2.0.0`

<Callout type="info">
  
  This section describes the changes between between `<2.0.0` and `>=2.0.0` versions of the `@spheron/storage` sdk.

</Callout>

- The versions `<2.0.0` require a token for Static Site organization. Version starting from `2.0.0` require a token for Storage organization.
- Changes in methods and interfaces:
  - [getUpload](/sdk/storage-v2/#get-upload) - The `Upload` interface has changed. `buildDirectory` property is renamed to `uploadDirectory`, and now it is an array of with both the name and the size of the uploaded files. The `UploadStatusEnum` has also changed.
  - [getOrganizationUsage](/sdk/storage-v2/#get-organization-usage) - New properties have been added.
  - [getBucket](/sdk/storage-v2/#get-bucket) - The `Bucket` interface does not include the domains anymore. To fetch the domains of the bucket you can use the [getBucketDomains](/sdk/storage-v2/#get-bucket-domains) method.
  - [getBucketUploadCount](/sdk/storage/#get-bucket-upload-count) - The method now only returns the total number of uploads.
  - [getBucketUploads](/sdk/storage/#get-bucket-upload-count) - The `Upload` interface has changed. `buildDirectory` property is renamed to `uploadDirectory`, and now it is an array of with both the name and the size of the uploaded files. The `UploadStatusEnum` has also changed.
  - IPNS Records are now grouped on the bucket level. Checkout the [section](/sdk/storage-v2/#ipns-records) for more details.
