# FVM Deal Utils SDK

The Spheron FVM Deal Utils SDK is equipped with multi-chain storage capabilities powered by Spheron.

<Callout type="warning">
  The package is only meant for Node.js environments and will not work in a
  browser or frontend apps.
</Callout>

## Installation

**Using NPM**

```
npm i @spheron/fvm-deal-utils
```

**Using Yarn**

```
yarn add @spheron/fvm-deal-utils
```

## Usage

To use the FVM Deal Utils SDK, you have to create an instance of `SpheronDealClient`.

```js
import { SpheronDealClient } from "@spheron/fvm-deal-utils";

const client = new SpheronDealClient({ token });
```

The `SpheronDealClient` constructor takes an object that has one property `token`.
Follow the instructions in the [DOCS](https://docs.spheron.network/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token) to generate this token.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** When you are creating the tokens, please choose **web app** type in
  the dashboard.
</Callout>

## Usage

In the example below you can see how to create an instance of SpheronDealClient and how to generate the metadata required for creating a storage deal on FVM.

```js
const {
  SpheronDealClient,
  DealDataResult,
} = require("@spheron/fvm-deal-utils");

const client = new SpheronDealClient({ token });

let currentlyUploaded = 0;
const result: DealDataResult = await client.getFvmMetadata(filePath, {
  name,
  onUploadInitiated: (uploadId) => {
    console.log(`Upload with id ${uploadId} started...`);
  },
  onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
    currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
    console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
  },
});
```

Function `getFvmMetadata` takes two parameters:

- **filePath** - (string) - The path to the file which will be transformed to a Car file and uploaded to IPFS
- **configuration:** An object with the following parameters:
  1.  `configuration.name (string)`
      - Represents the name of the bucket on which you are uploading the Car file.
  2.  `configuration.onUploadInitiated` **(Optional)**
      - Callback function `(uploadId: string) => void`. The function will be called once, when the upload is initiated, right before the data is uploaded. The function will be called with one parameter, `uploadId`, which represents the id of the started upload.
  3.  `configuration.onChunkUploaded` **(Optional)**
      - Callback function `(uploadedSize: number, totalSize: number) => void`. The function will be called multiple times, depending on the upload size. The function will be called each time a chunk is uploaded, with two parameters. The first one `uploadedSize` represents, the size in Bytes for the uploaded chunk. The `totalSize` represents the total size of the upload in Bytes.

**Response**

```js
interface DealDataResult {
  pieceSize: number; // the size of the file in bytes
  size: number; // the size of the CAR file in bytes
  pieceCid: string; // hash of the piece in hex
  dataCid: string; // IPFS hash of the car file
  carLink: string; // the IPFS link to the car
  carName: string; // the name of the car
  uploadId: string; // the id of the upload
}
```
