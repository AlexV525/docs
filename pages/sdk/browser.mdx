# Browser Upload SDK

The Browser Upload SDK is equipped with multi-chain storage capabilities powered by Spheron.

<Callout type="warning">
  The package is only meant for Browser environments.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** You need to generate an `uploadToken` for uploading data with
  Browser Upload SDK. You can do that by [creating a server](browser/#server).
</Callout>

## Installation

**Using NPM**

```
npm i @spheron/browser-upload
```

**Using Yarn**

```
yarn add @spheron/browser-upload
```

## Usage

The Browser SDK allows you to upload files directly from your browser to `IPFS`, `Filecoin`, or `Arweave`. \
To use the Browser SDK, you have to set up the following:

1. A web server will be used by the frontend to get the `uploadToken` for uploading the data.
2. A web app that uses `@spheron/browser-upload` to upload files directly from the browser.

> You can checkout the working example [here](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/tree/main/examples/browser-upload).

### Server

You have to set up a web server with an endpoint that will be used by the frontend to fetch the token for upload.
In the example, we have created a `/initiate-upload` endpoint.
Make use of the `createSingleUploadToken` method from `@spheron/storage` package to generate the `uploadToken`.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The `uploadToken` can only be used for a single upload and has an
  expiration of 10 minutes.
</Callout>

```js
import { SpheronClient, ProtocolEnum } from "@spheron/storage";

...

app.get("/initiate-upload", async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    const bucketName = "example-browser-upload"; // use your preferred name
    const protocol = ProtocolEnum.IPFS; // use your preferred protocol
    const token = process.env.SPHERON_TOKEN; // add your access token in .env or paste it here

    const client = new SpheronClient({ token });

    const { uploadToken } = await client.createSingleUploadToken({
      name: bucketName,
      protocol,
    });

    res.status(200).json({
      uploadToken,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    next(error);
  }
});
```

You need to [Create an Access Token](/rest-api/#creating-an-access-token) to create the client.

Function `createSingleUploadToken` takes two parameters:

- **name** - (string) - Represents the name of the bucket on which you are uploading the data.
- **protocol** - (string) - The protocol on which the data will be uploaded. The supported protocols are [ `ARWEAVE`, `IPFS`, `FILECOIN`].

**Response**

```js
interface TokenRes {
  uploadToken: string;
}
```

### Client

The `browser-upload` provides three methods:

#### Upload

You have to send a request to your server to create the `uploadToken` that will be used to upload files from the browser.
In the example, we are sending a request to the `/initiate-upload` endpoint.
Make use of the `upload` method from `@spheron/browser-upload` to upload your files.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The `uploadToken` can only be used for a single upload and has an
  expiration of 10 minutes.
</Callout>

```js
import { upload } from "@spheron/browser-upload";

...

const response = await fetch(`<BACKEND_URL>/initiate-upload`); // get the temporary access token from the server
const resJson = await response.json();
const token =  resJson.uploadToken;

let currentlyUploaded = 0;

const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } = await upload(files, {
  token,
  onChunkUploaded: (uploadedSize, totalSize) => {
    currentlyUploaded += uploadedSize;
    console.log(`Uploaded ${currentlyUploaded} of ${totalSize} Bytes.`);
  },
});

...
```

This flow allows you to control who can use your `uploadToken` to upload files. \
Function `upload` takes two parameters:

- **files** - ( File[] | FileList ) - An array of files to be uploaded.
- **configuration:** An object with the following parameters:
  1.  `configuration.token`
      - The upload token was fetched from the server.
  2.  `configuration.onChunkUploaded` **(Optional)**
      - callback function `(uploadedSize: number, totalSize: number) => void`. The function will be called multiple times, depending on the upload size. The function will be called each time a chunk is uploaded, with two parameters. The first one `uploadedSize` represents the size in Bytes for the uploaded chunk. The `totalSize` represents the total size of the upload in Bytes.

**Response**

```js
interface UploadRes {
  uploadId: string;
  bucketId: string;
  protocolLink: string;
  dynamicLinks: string[];
  cid: string;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The CID property will only have value for IPFS and Filecoin uploads.
</Callout>

#### Encrypt Upload

Used to encrypt a string or a file and upload it to IPFS.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Both the `encryptUpload` functions require an instance of
  LitNodeClient that is already connected. To create an instance, checkout the
  [@lit-protocol/lit-node-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-protocol/lit-node-client)
  package or our
  [example](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/browser-upload/client/src/lit.ts)
</Callout>

```js
const { uploadId, bucketId, protocolLink, dynamicLinks } =
  await spheron.encryptUpload({
    authSig,
    accessControlConditions,
    chain,
    filePath,
    litNodeClient: client,
    configuration: {
      token,
    },
  });
```

Parameters of `encryptUpload`:

- **authSig** - (optional) The authSig of the user. You can use `checkAndSignAuthMessage` function from [@lit-protocol/lit-node-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-protocol/lit-node-client) to create it. Checkout the [example](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/browser-upload/client/src/lit.ts).
- **sessionSigs:** - (optional) the session signatures to use to authorize the user with the nodes.
- **accessControlConditions** - (optional) The access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token. This could be possession of an NFT, for example.
- **evmContractConditions** - (optional) EVM Smart Contract access control conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token. This could be possession of an NFT, for example. This is different than accessControlConditions because accessControlConditions only supports a limited number of contract calls. evmContractConditions supports any contract call.
- **solRpcConditions** - (optional) Solana RPC call conditions that the user must meet to obtain this signed token. This could be possession of an NFT, for example.
- **unifiedAccessControlConditions** - (optional) An array of unified access control conditions. You may use `AccessControlCondition`, `EVMContractCondition`, or `SolRpcCondition` objects in this array, but make sure you add a conditionType for each one.
  <Callout type="info">
    **NOTE:** The function requires either `accessControlConditions`,
    `evmContractConditions`, `solRpcConditions` or
    `unifiedAccessControlConditions`.
  </Callout>
- **chain** - The chain name of the chain that this contract is deployed on.
- **string** - (optional) The string you wish to encrypt.
- **file** - (optional) The File you wish to encrypt.

  <Callout type="info">
    **NOTE:** The function requires either `string` of `file` parameters to be
    passed.
  </Callout>

- **litNodeClient** - An instance of LitNodeClient that is already connected.
- **configuration**:
  - **token** - The upload token was fetched from the server.
  - **onChunkUploaded** - (optional) callback function `(uploadedSize: number, totalSize: number) => void`. The function will be called multiple times, depending on the upload size. The function will be called each time a chunk is uploaded, with two parameters. The first one `uploadedSize` represents the size in Bytes for the uploaded chunk. The `totalSize` represents the total size of the upload in Bytes.

**Response**

```js
interface UploadRes {
  uploadId: string;
  bucketId: string;
  protocolLink: string;
  dynamicLinks: Domain[];
  cid: string;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Checkout the
  [example](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/browser-upload/)
  on how to use `encryptUpload` function.

#### Decrypt Upload

Used to decrypt the data of the previously encrypted upload.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Both the `decryptUpload` functions require an instance of
  LitNodeClient that is already connected. To create an instance, checkout the
  [@lit-protocol/lit-node-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-protocol/lit-node-client)
  package or our
  [example](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/browser-upload/client/src/lit.ts)
</Callout>

  authSig,
  ipfsCid,
  litNodeClient,
});
```

Function `decryptUpload` parameters:

- **authSig** - (optional) The authSig of the user. You can use `checkAndSignAuthMessage` function from [@lit-protocol/lit-node-client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@lit-protocol/lit-node-client) to create it Checkout the [example](https://github.com/spheronFdn/sdk/blob/main/examples/browser-upload/client/src/lit.ts).
