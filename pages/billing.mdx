## Overdue

Your organization reaches an overdue state when you exceed the usage of some of its resources.
You can choose any one of the following to satisfy the constraint limits to get out of the overdue state:

1. Buy a subscription to increase your resources.
2. Buy a bonus for a specific resource that is exceeding.
3. Remove specific resources manually.

### Pay Overdue

Follow these steps to pay overdue:

1. Click Pay Overdue in the Current Plan section under the Billing tab.
2. Review the details and Click Pay.

## Cancel subscription

### For All Networks except Solana

You cannot remove an active subscription. However, you can stop its automatic renewal from next month.

To stop the automatic renewal of your bonus:

1. Go to the Current Plan section under the Billing tab.
2. Click Cancel Plan to cancel its renewal.

  **NOTE:** You can still use the current month's subscription after you stop
  its renewal.

### For Solana

You cannot remove an active subscription. All payments are made upfront. So there is no auto-renewal in this case.
