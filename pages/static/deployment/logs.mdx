# Deployment

You can deploy static sites on Spheron by connecting your Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket account.
Currently, Spheron supports 20+ frameworks. That includes React, Next, Gatsby, and many more.

## Connect Git Provider

Spheron supports the following Git providers: [Github](https://github.com/), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/).
When you connect a git provider, Spheron automatically syncs all your repositories.

Spheron provides deploy logs for every project that you deploy. These logs are similar to the build logs of your framework. A record of each deployment is maintained on the Deployments page. \
To view the deploy logs:

1. Click on a "deployment."
2. Scroll down to the **Deploy logs** section.
