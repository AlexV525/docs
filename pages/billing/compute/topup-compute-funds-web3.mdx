To ensure your compute clusters continue to run uninterupted, you need enough funds in your balance to pay for future hourly usage.

**Follow these Steps to Top Up your Compute Balance:**

1. Navigate to the Compute Billing page.
2. Click "Top Up."
3. Select Web3 Wallet Payment Method.
4. Add the amount you want to deposit in USD and click "Purchase."

Enjoy uninterrupted service with automatic top ups.

<Callout type="info">
  Just a heads-up: with our Auto Top-Up, we'll keep your balance in good shape
  by topping it up every month, starting from the day you turn it on. Don't
  forget to set how much you want to add, or you can always tweak it later. Need
  a hand figuring out the right amount? Just check out your hourly usage on the
  billing page, and it'll give you a pretty good idea of what you might need
  each month.
</Callout>

**Follow these Steps to Setup an Automatic Top Up for your Compute Balance:**

1. Navigate to the Compute Billing page.
2. Toggle on the Auto Top up option.
3. Enter a recurring amount(At least $15 USD).
4. Click "Schedule."

Ensure your auto top up amount covers your [monthly compute usage](/billing/compute/compute-usage/).
