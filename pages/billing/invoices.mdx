# Invoices & Usages

## Invoices

Spheron offers the flexibility to customize and manage your invoices efficiently. You can find "Invoice Settings" under the **Billing** tab.

### Invoice Details

- **Company Name:** In the Invoice Details section, you can specify your company name. By default, the team name is displayed on invoices,
  but if you wish to use a custom company name, you can easily add it here.

- **Invoice Email Recipient:** You can configure a custom email recipient to ensure that invoices reach the intended party.
  By default, all invoices are sent to the email address of the team creator.
  This feature is particularly useful for scenarios where invoices need to be directed to a specific department or individual within your organization.
