3. Plan Details:
   - Read the transaction details and Click "Deposit." If you have already deposited the funds, you can move to step 5.
4. Deposit Funds:
   - To make sure your subscription is renewed every month, you need to deposit funds to the Spheron escrow wallet.
   - Add the amount you want to approve and Click "Approve." This amount should be more than or equal to the plan's Token-Value (total amount).
   - Add the amount you want to deposit and Click "Deposit." Make sure it is not more than the approved amount, or else the transaction will fail.
5. Click "Upgrade Plan" to initiate the transaction. Upon successful transaction, the plan will be upgraded to Pro.

  Wallet** dropdown.
