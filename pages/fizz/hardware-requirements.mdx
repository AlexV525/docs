# Fizz Hardware Requirements and Recommendations

## Software Recommendation

Fizz nodes are supported on **MacOS and Linux**, with Windows support coming soon. Your experience may vary depending on the operating system used.

## Fizz Node Requirements

### Minimum Specs
- 4 CPU
- 8 GB RAM
- 100 GB disk

### Maximum Specs
- 12 CPU
- 16 GB RAM
- 500 GB disk


<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** You need to have root or sudo access to your system for the Fizz node to run in privileged mode. This elevated access is necessary for the node to perform certain operations that require system-level permissions.
</Callout>

{/* ### Recommendations

- The more resources you have, the better, especially if your goal is to maximize performance.
- Any consumer-grade GPU works for Fizz nodes. The supported list is the same as what we have in GPU tiering. */}

{/* <Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** For optimal performance, we recommend using hardware that meets or exceeds the recommended specifications.
