# Fizz Node FAQ

#### 1. Is Docker installation mandatory before installing a Fizz Node?
No, it's not mandatory. The Fizz Node installation script handles Docker installation for you. However, if you already have Docker installed, please ensure it is updated to the latest version.

#### 2. How do I know if my Fizz Node is active?
To check if your Fizz Node is active, visit [Fizz Node Status](https://fizz.spheron.network/). If it shows as active, your node is running. If not, please reach out to our Discord community for assistance.

#### 3. How much can I earn, or is there a token allocated to Fizz Node Runners?
Spheron aims to maximize your earnings by creating a resource pool of idle resources. However, your earnings depend on various factors, including demand. In addition to direct utilization points, Spheron offers IDLE rewards in Fizz Node Points. The network requires a token to operate, and any related information will be communicated publicly.

#### 4. Can I run a Fizz Node on a Windows device?
Support for Windows is currently unavailable, but you can run it on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
