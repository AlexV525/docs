# Setup Ansible

This guide will walk you through setting up and deploying a provider using Ansible. The steps cover installation on a local system, configuring a remote server, and managing deployments. This document provides best practices and recommendations for doing so.

## Prerequisites

- A Linux server with Ubuntu 22.04.
- Ansible installed on your local machine.
- Basic knowledge of server administration, Ansible, and Kubernetes.

To install Ansible on a Mac, you can use various methods such as Homebrew, pip, or by installing it from source. Here are the steps for each method:

**Note:** The first 1, 2, & 3 sections need to be done within your local system, and then SSH to a remote server to set up everything for the provider.

## 1. Setup Ansible Using Homebrew

### Install Homebrew 
If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, open Terminal and run:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)>"
```

### Install Ansible
Once Homebrew is installed, run:

```
brew install ansible
```
### Verify the Installation
Check the version of Ansible to confirm it's installed:

```
ansible --version
```

## 2. Setup Domain for the Provider

## 3. Prepare Linux Instance for Installation Using Ansible

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone this repo onto your local system: GitHub - [spheronFdn/provider-deployment](https://github.com/spheronFdn/provider-deployment)

```
git clone https://github.com/spheronFdn/provider-deployment
```
Repo has the following file structure:

### Step 2: Edit Inventory File 

Now, edit the `playbook/inventory.ini` file with your server details, Example:

```
[instance-1] ansible_host=[23.158.40.38] ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file=[~/.ssh/id_rsa]
```

<Callout type="info">
Properly set up server IP, user_name, and the SSH key.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Edit Playbook
Now edit the hostname in `playbook/playbook.yaml`

```
hostname: [provider.com]        ## this can be your registered domain name that will be used for the provider
```

### Step 4: Execute the Playbook
Now execute the playbook 

```
cd playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```
After the whole execution, the server will restart.
