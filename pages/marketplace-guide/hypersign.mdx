# How to deploy a Hypersign Node?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Hypersign, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Hypersign node:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
3. Pick **Hypersign** from the marketplace.
4. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
5. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **eu-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
6. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
7. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
8. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
9. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#additional-configuration-1) to know more.
10. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advance Configuration

- **Root Password** - The password associated with Hypersign.
- **Moniker** - The user-defined identifier assigned to a validator or staking entity on a blockchain network. It helps distinguish and recognize the specific validator node within the network.
- **Link Key** - The cryptographic key used to establish a secure connection between different components or entities within the staking infrastructure.
- **Github Repository** - The link to Hypersign's Github Repository.
- **Snap RPC** - The Snap RPC details for the Hypersign instance.
- **Token** - The token for the Hypersign instance.

## Verify Installation

The Hypersign Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

For more information, refer to the [Hypersign docs](https://docs.hypersign.id/).
