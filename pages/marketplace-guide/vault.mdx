# How to deploy HashiCorp Vault?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with HashiCorp Vault, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Vault:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
3. Pick **HashiCorp Vault** from the marketplace.
4. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
5. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **eu-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
6. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
7. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
8. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
9. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#additional-configuration-1) to know more.
10. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advance Configuration

- **Token Id** - The Token ID used for authentication with HashiCorp Vault. This token provides access to perform operations and retrieve secrets from the Vault.
- **Listen Address** - The network address and port where HashiCorp Vault will listen for incoming connections. This address determines how clients can reach the Vault server.

## Verify Installation

HashiCorp Vault can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to HashiCorp Vault?

- Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info** to access the Vault dashboard.
- For login, use the `Root Token` from the instance logs.
