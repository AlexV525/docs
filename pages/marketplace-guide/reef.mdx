# How to deploy a Reef Node?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Reef, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Reef node:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
3. Pick **Reef** from the marketplace.
4. Choose your desired Scaling option under **Scaling**.
5. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for no scaling, or in the **eu-east** region for manual scaling. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
6. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
7. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
8. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
9. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#additional-configuration-1) to know more.
10. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advance Configuration

- **Network** - The network to be used for the Reef instance.
- **Archive Node** - `Yes` if you want to archive your node, otherwise `No`.

## Verify Installation

The Reef Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

For more information, refer to the [Reef docs](https://docs.reef.io/docs/developers/nodes/).
