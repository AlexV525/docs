# How to deploy PostgreSQL?

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with PostgreSQL, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy PostgreSQL:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
3. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
4. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
5. Pick **Postgres** from the marketplace.
6. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **eu-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
7. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
8. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
9. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
10. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
11. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** The default values for **User**, **Password** and **Database** is
  `admin`, `password` and `mydb`, respectively.
</Callout>

## Advance Configuration

- **User** - The user for accessing the PostgreSQL database.
- **Password** - The password associated with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Database** - The name for the PostgreSQL database.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own PostgreSQL with Spheron:

## Verify Installation

PostgreSQL can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to PostgreSQL?

You can use the connection string URI to connect to PostgreSQL.
The standard URI connection scheme has the following format:

```
postgresql://[username:password@]host[:port][/dbname]
```

- `postgresql://` - A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format.
- `username:password` - Authentication credentials passed in App Configuration.
- `host[:port]` - The host and port number where the postgresql instance is running. Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info**.
- `/dbname` - The name of the database passed in App Configuration.

Run the following command in your terminal to test your connection:

```sh
psql postgresql://[username:password@]host[:port][/dbname]
```

For more information, refer to the [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html).
