# How to deploy an Fuel Beta-4 Node?

<VideoPlayer embedId="XDOUn6mibHM" />

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Fuel Beta-4 Node, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Fuel node:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
3. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
4. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
5. Pick **Fuel Beta-4 Node** from the marketplace.
6. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **us-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
7. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
8. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
9. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
10. Add your "Service Name" and "Sepolia Rpc Endpoint" under **Template Configuration**.
11. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

  **NOTE:** You can get a Sepolia Rpc Endpoint from either
  [Infura](https://www.infura.io/) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/).

## Verify Installation

- The Fuel Beta-4 Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- As the node starts, the **Instance Logs** will display the output about the operations performed. If you see messages that blocks are being proposed and finalized, you have a running node.

## Generating a P2P Key

You can generate a new P2P key pairing by running the following command in the **Shell**:

```
> ls
 chainConfig.json  fuel-key.txt peering-setup.sh
> cat fuel-key.txt
 {"peer_id":"16Uiu2HAm8kCaJaaKTujrSwdBxyCELTY979KYaP9YBkWVLTGTo7Bf","secret":"361b3275a3dd4150ea4c786b8dff7822205331e56ac2e73c32b17cb295978c8c","type":"p2p"}
```

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Make sure you save this somewhere safe so you don't need to generate
  a new key pair in the future.
</Callout>
