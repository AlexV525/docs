# How to deploy a MassBit Route Gateway Node?

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with MassBit Gateway, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a MassBit Route Gatewayt node:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
3. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.z
4. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
5. Pick **MassBit Route Gateway** from the marketplace.
6. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **eu-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
7. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
8. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
9. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
10. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
11. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advance Configuration

- **Token** - The token for the MassBit Gateway instance.
- **GW ID** - The Gateway ID for the MassBit Gateway instance.

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own MassBit Route Gateway Node with Spheron:

## Verify Installation

The MassBit Route Gateway Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

For more information, refer to the [Massbit docs](https://docs.massbit.io/about/massbit-intro).
