# How to deploy a Jupyter Notebook?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Jupyter Notebook, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Jupyter Notebook:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
3. Pick **Jupyter Notebook** from the marketplace.
4. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
5. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **eu-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
6. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
7. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
8. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
9. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#additional-configuration-1) to know more.
10. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Verify Installation

The Jupyter Notebook dashboard can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to Jupyter Notebook?

- Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info** to access the Jupyter Notebook where there will be `mnist-train.ipynb`.

For more information, refer to the [Jupyter Notebook docs](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/index.html).
