# How to deploy a Jupyter Notebook?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Jupyter Notebook, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Jupyter Notebook:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Select marketplace app**.
3. Pick **Jupyter Notebook** from the marketplace.
4. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template.
5. If you want to change the plan, Click "Change Plan".
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs, and Click "Select Plan".
7. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in any region. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
8. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advanced Configuration

### Region

Refer to the [region section](/compute/cluster/#region) for more information.

## Verify Installation

The Jupyter Notebook dashboard can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to Jupyter Notebook?

- Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info** to access the Jupyter Notebook where there will be `mnist-train.ipynb`.

For more information, refer to the [Jupyter Notebook docs](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/index.html).
