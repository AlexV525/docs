  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Elixir, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Elixir validator node:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
3. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
4. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
5. Pick **Elixir Validator** from the marketplace.
6. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **us-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
7. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
8. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
9. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
10. Add your "wallet address" and "private key" under **Template Configuration**.
11. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Enroll your wallet as a Validator

- Navigate to the [Elixir Network Dashboard](https://dashboard.elixir.finance/) with your wallet-connected browser.
- Connect with Metamask and switch to the Goerli network.
- Click "claim ELXR" next to the **Actions** section.
- After receiving ELXR tokens, proceed to stake any amount between **100-1000 ELXR**.
- Click "enroll" under Actions, and then enter the **wallet address** added while deploying up your validator.
- Once the transaction is confirmed, ensure that valid orders are being processed by checking the **Instance Logs** section on the Spheron Instance page.
