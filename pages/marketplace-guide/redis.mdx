# How to deploy Redis?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Redis, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy Redis:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
3. Pick **Redis** from the marketplace.
4. Choose your desired Scaling option under **Scaling**.
5. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for no scaling, or in the **eu-east** region for manual scaling. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
6. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
7. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
8. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
9. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#additional-configuration-1) to know more.
10. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advance Configuration

- **Password** - The password associated with the Redis database.

## Verify Installation

Redis can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### How to connect to Redis?

You can use the connection string URI to connect to Redis.
The standard URI connection scheme has the following format:

```
redis://[password@]host[:port]
```

- `redis://` - A required prefix to identify that this is a string in the standard connection format.
- `password` - Authentication credentials passed in App Configuration.
- `host[:port]` - The host and port number where the redis instance is running. Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info**.

Run the following command in your terminal to test your connection:

```sh
$ redis-cli -u redis://[password@]host[:port] PING
PONG
```

For more information, refer to the [Redis docs](https://redis.io/docs/ui/cli/).
