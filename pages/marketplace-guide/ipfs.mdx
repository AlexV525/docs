# How to deploy an IPFS Node?

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with IPFS, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy an IPFS node:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
3. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
4. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
5. Pick **IPFS** from the marketplace.
6. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **eu-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
7. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
8. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
9. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
10. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#advance-configuration-1) to know more.
11. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Verify Installation

The IPFS Node can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.

### Upload files to IPFS using IPFS WebUI

Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info for Port 5001** and append `/webui` to access the IPFS Web interface.

### Access files using IPFS Gateway

Use the `Connection URL` provided by Spheron under **Port Policy Info for Port 8080** and append `/ipfs/{cid}` to access your file directly from the IPFS network.

For more information, refer to the [IPFS docs](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/desktop-app/#install-ipfs-desktop).
