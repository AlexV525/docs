# How to deploy an Pryzm Validator Testnet?

<VideoPlayer embedId="3yVCl8luZBQ" />

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Spheron Compute offers the flexibility to create custom
  configurations for your instance.
</Callout>

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with Pryzm, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy a Pryzm validator testnet:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Choose "Compute" to use CPU-based instances for running containers.
3. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
4. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
5. Pick **Pryzm Validator Testnet** from the marketplace.
6. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **us-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/compute/#region) to know more.
7. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
8. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. You can use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your CPU based instance.
9. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
10. Add your "Moniker" under **Template Configuration**.
11. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Verify Installation

- The Pryzm Validator Testnet can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
  Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
- As the node starts, the **Instance Logs** will display the output about the operations performed. You can refresh the logs by clicking the refresh icon.

### Prepare Your Environment

1. Before issuing any commands, initialize your environment by running:

```sh
. $HOME/.profile
```

2. If you encounter an error that says **`/bin/sh: 1: pryzmd: not found`**, run the same command again to fix it.

### Create or Recover Your Wallet

1. **To create a new wallet**

```sh
pryzmd keys add wallet
```

2. **To recover an existing wallet**

```sh
pryzmd keys add wallet --recover
```

Then, enter your mnemonic phrase when prompted.

### Fund Your Wallet

1. Visit the [faucet app](https://testnet.pryzm.zone/faucet) to request test tokens for your wallet.
2. Check your wallet balance using:

```sh
pryzmd q bank balances $(pryzmd keys show wallet -a)
```

Make sure you receive at least **2 upryzm** tokens.

3. If you don't see a balance, your node might still be syncing with the blockchain. Wait until the **`catching_up`** status is **`false`**.
4. Monitor your wallet on the Pryzm Explorer: Keep an eye on your transactions and balance by visiting [Pryzm Explorer](https://testnet.chainsco.pe/pryzm) and entering your wallet address. This step is crucial for ensuring that your wallet has been successfully funded and is correctly reflecting the transactions on the blockchain.

### Verify Network Synchronization

Check the synchronization status with:

```sh
pryzmd status | jq .SyncInfo
```

Proceed when **`catching_up`** turns to **`false`**.

### Register Your Validator

1. Use the following command to create your validator, replacing placeholders with your information:

```sh
pryzmd tx staking create-validator --amount 1000000upryzm --pubkey $(pryzmd tendermint show-validator) --moniker "your-moniker-name" --details "your-details" --website "your-website" --security-contact "your-email" --chain-id indigo-1 --commission-rate 0.05 --commission-max-rate 0.20 --commission-max-change-rate 0.01 --min-self-delegation 1 --from wallet --gas-adjustment 1.4 --gas auto --gas-prices 0.015upryzm -y
```

2. Customize the command with your details: <br /> Replace **`your-moniker-name`**, **`your-details`**, **`your-website`**, and **`your-email`** with your own information.
3. Wait a few minutes after executing this command, before checking your node on the [Pryzm validators list](https://testnet.chainsco.pe/pryzm/validators).

## Deploy Your Own

Deploy your own Pryzm Validator Testnet with Spheron:
