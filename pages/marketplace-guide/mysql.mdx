# How to deploy MySQL?

Spheron allows you to deploy a compute instance pre-installed with MySQL, all set up and ready to use on the Akash Network.
To deploy MySQL:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Start from Marketplace App**.
3. Pick **MySQL** from the marketplace.
4. Choose your desired Compute Type option under **Compute Type**.
5. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in **any** region for **Spot**, or in the **eu-east** region for **On Demand**. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
6. Spheron will automatically select the recommended plan for the specific template. If you intend to move forward with the recommended plan, just Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.
7. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
8. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
9. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#additional-configuration-1) to know more.
10. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Advance Configuration

- **Password** - The password associated with the MySQL database.

## Verify Installation

MySQL can be accessed only after the Compute Instance is provisioned.
Thus, you need to wait for the installation to complete before you can start using it.
