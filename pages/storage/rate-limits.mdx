# Rate Limits

## Global Rate Limits

At Spheron, we believe in providing you with the flexibility and resources you need to manage your data effectively.
However, to ensure the fair and efficient operation of our platform, we have established global rate limits for Storage.
These limits are designed to accommodate a wide range of use cases while maintaining system stability.
Here are the key global rate limits:

- **Parallel Uploads:** We support initiating up to 500 parallel uploads simultaneously, allowing for efficient data transfer.
- **Filesize:** We support individual file sizes of up to 15 gigabytes (GB) for ease in handling large data objects.
- **Number of Files per Request:** Our platform supports up to 10,000 files per request, offering flexibility in how the data is organized and managed.
- **Timeout:** The system provides a generous timeout of 30 minutes for each operation, ensuring that complex tasks have ample time to complete successfully.

| **Resource**                    | **Limit**  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Parallel Uploads**            | 500        |
| **Filesize**                    | 15 GB      |
| **Number of Files per Request** | 10,000 \*  |
| **Timeout**                     | 30 minutes |

\* Can be changed based on scaling requirements.

## Plan Rate Limits

  **NOTE:** By default, Filecoin storage utilizes IPFS storage. Therefore,
  storage consumption is capped at the IPFS storage limit. In simpler terms, you
  can upload until you reach the IPFS storage capacity.
