## Pin and Unpin

### Pin

Spheron Storage provides a pinning service that enables users to upload new assets or link an existing asset on IPFS
with a Spheron IPFS node. This functionality facilitates the migration of assets to Spheron
while guaranteeing the preservation and continued availability of the data associated with the CID on
the IPFS network.

### Unpin

Unpinning is the reverse process of pinning in Spheron Storage. It involves removing the association
between a CID and a Spheron IPFS node, effectively instructing the node to stop storing the
data related to that CID.
