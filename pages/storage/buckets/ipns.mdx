# IPNS

The InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) is a system for creating such mutable pointers to CIDs known as names or IPNS names.
IPNS names can be thought of as links that can be updated over time, while retaining the verifiability of content addressing.

## Storage SDK

Spheron Storage SDK offers a set of key functions for handling IPNS records effectively. You can retrieve all IPNS records
associated with a specific bucket, fetch detailed information about a particular IPNS record, publish new IPNS records to link
to specific uploads, update existing IPNS records to point to different content, and delete IPNS records as needed. Each IPNS
record object contains essential metadata, including the IPNS hash, link, memory usage, bucket ID, and timestamps for creation
and updates.

With the IPNS SDK, you gain precise control over your IPNS records, making it easier to manage dynamic data and ensure that
your applications always access the most up-to-date content, all while benefiting from the robustness and verifiability of the
IPFS ecosystem.
