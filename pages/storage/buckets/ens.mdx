# ENS Domains

[ENS (Ethereum Name Service)](https://ens.domains/) is a Blockchain domain naming protocol built especially for the Ethereum Blockchain. It allows you to create human-friendly and readable usernames for your dApps.

## Attach an ENS Domain

1. Select your desired Bucket from the Storage dashboard.
2. Go to the **ENS Domains** section under the **Domains** tab.
3. Enter your ENS Domain name and Select the link that you want your domain to point to.
4. Click "Add." You will see the selected configuration on the screen.
5. With Spheron, you can update your ENS content hash directly from the app. Make the required changes, Click "Update" and confirm the transaction on Metamask to update the content hash. You can verify it in your ENS Domain Manager.
6. To manually update the content hash of your ENS domain, Go to your **ENS dashboard** and Update your content hash with the CONTENT provided by Spheron.
7. Click "Verify" to verify the update, and we will verify the records for you.

2. Go to the **ENS Domains** section under the **Domains** tab.
3. Click "Edit" on the ENS Domain that you wish to edit.

  **NOTE:** <br /> Updating your domain name or content will always ask you to
  Update the record, as it changes the content hash.
</Callout>

## How does the update action work?

With Spheron, you can make the necessary changes to your ENS content hash directly from the app.
Once you make the desired changes, Click the "Update" button to initiate the update process.
Spheron will then prompt you to confirm the transaction on Metamask.
Once the transaction is confirmed, you can verify that the update was successful by checking your ENS Domain Manager.

## Access your ENS domains with Supported Resolvers

### Using an ENS-compatible browser

If you are using an ENS-compatible browser, like Brave, or if you have the MetaMask extension installed, you can type: **'address.eth/' (remember the '/')** in the search bar to resolve your address.

### Using eth.link​

This service, made available by ENS and Cloudflare, makes all the **'.eth'** domains accessible via traditional DNS addresses. Anyone can visit your site using **'.link'**! If you do not have them, you can add the **'.link'** suffix to visit your ENS domain on any browser.

### Using eth.limo​

Cloudflare's **'eth.link'** is centralized and can experience downtimes. An alternative to 'eth.link' is **'eth.limo'.** In that case, you can add the **'.limo'** suffix to visit your ENS domain.

<Callout type="warning">
  All these are third-party resolving options you can use to visit your '.eth'
  ENS domains. Contact the concerned providers if you face any issues after
  configuring your ENS record properly.
