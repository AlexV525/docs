# Domains Configuration

By default, Spheron provides a subdomain when a bucket is created.
You have the option to attach your own domain and point it to the uploaded files.

## Attach a Domain

Follow these steps to configure your domain:

1. Select your desired Bucket from the Storage dashboard.
2. Go to the **Domains** tab in the **Domain** section under the **Buckets** tab.
3. Enter your Domain name and Select the link that you want your domain to point to.
4. Click "Add."
5. Add the records shown in the platform to your DNS provider and wait for the domain records to propagate.
6. Click "Verify" after a few minutes. Your domain will connect to the deployment.

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** <br /> 1\. You can visit https://dnschecker.org/ to verify if your
  DNS is propagated. <br /> 2\. You cannot assign the same domain to multiple
  IPFS links within either the same organization or across different
  organizations. If you wish to update your domain, you must first remove it
  from any previous associations where it was previously in use.
