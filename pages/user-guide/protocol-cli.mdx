# Spheron Protocol CLI

Explore detailed steps and options of the Spheron Protocol CLI. In this guide we will define each environment variable and use within each command.

## Install Spheron Protocol CLI (Linux, MacOS)

### Prerequisites

To install Spheron Protocol CLI using script, make sure you have [`curl`](https://curl.se/) installed on your system. To check, quickly:

```sh
curl --version
```

### Install Spheron Protocol CLI

1. To install the Spheron Protocol CLI on the system, just run this one command in your terminal and pass the password during the prompt:

```sh
curl -sL1 https://sphnctl.sh | bash
```

2. Verify Spheron Installation

```sh
# Verify the installation by using a simple command to check the Spheron version
sphnctl -h
```

## Wallet Configurations

### Creating a Wallet

To create a new wallet, start by configuring the name of your key. Run the command below, replacing `[wallet name]` with a name of your choice:

```sh
sphnctl wallet create --name [Wallet Name]
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Created account xxx:
 path: /Users/mitrasish-personal/.spheron/xxxxxyx.json
 address: 0x5C2432F3cB41927212e46e7224036d78eF3F2A93
 secret: xxxxxxxxxx
 mnemonic: xxxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxx
```

Make sure to read the output carefully and save your mnemonic phrase and key secret in a secure location. 

Once created, the wallet will be saved locally at `~/.spheron`. You can access the key-secret of the current wallet in `~/.spheron/config.json`. 
The newly created wallet will automatically be set as the current wallet. If needed, you can change the wallet by following the instructions in the "Changing Your Wallet" section.

### Checking the Current Wallet

To see which wallet is currently in use for deployments, run the following command:

```sh
sphnctl wallet current
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Currently using account xxx:
	path: /Users/mitrasish-personal/.spheron/abc.json
	address: 0x2c11A76298A111B8cAASCCS205dc8f0A268ASCS
	passphrase: testPaxxxx
```

### Changing Your Wallet

If you need to switch to a different wallet, use the command below, providing the name and the key-secret of the new wallet:

```sh
sphnctl wallet use --name [Wallet Name] --key-secret [Key Secret]
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Switched default account to xxx:
	path: /Users/mitrasish-personal/.spheron/acbv.json
	address: 0x2c11A76298A111B8cAAvvvvvv05dc8f0A268ASCS
	passphrase: test
```
This will update the current wallet to the specified one.

## Account Overview

You need to fund your wallet with some ETH to deploy anything on Spheron. We are currently deployed on Arbitrum chain, you can try getting some ETH from the faucet or buy it from the market to pay for the transaction fees.

### Depositing Balance

You need to deposit some minimum balance of any token to your account before doing any deployment. Any deployment on Spheron need user to deposit some amount of token that is used for the deployment otherwise the deployment will not start. To deposit a specific token like USDT, you need to run this command:

```sh
sphnctl payment deposit --amount [Amount] --token [Token Name]
```
Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Successfully deposited [Amount] [Token Name]! Start deploying!!!
Tx hash: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xc33a13a0e5e07ca54fea6077f7d14052ac65cf36682983cc69eed16a162ab1f1
```

The amount you pass need to be in full precision i.e if the USDT has 6 precision then the amount of 1 USDT will be 1000000.

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** Precision is crucial for any deployment on Spheron. All token values passed in ICL or CLI must have the correct precision. For details on token precision, refer to the [Supported Payment Token](/user-guide/supports#supported-payment-tokens) section.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** There is a restriction on minimum of 15$ deposited funds in your account of any token to start any deployment
</Callout>

### Withdrawing Balance

To withdraw a specific token, you need to run this command:

```bash
sphnctl payment withdraw --amount [Amount] --token [Token Name]
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```bash
Successfully withdrawn [Amount] [Token Name]! 
Tx hash: https://arbiscan.io/tx/0xc33a13a0e5e07ca54fea6077f7d14052ac65cf36682983cc69eed16a162ab1f1

If you want to deposit some other token, Please do this:
sphnctl payment deposit --amount [Amount] --token [Token Name]
```

The amount you pass need to be in full precision i.e if the USDT has 6 precision then the amount of 1 USDT will be 1000000.

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** Precision is crucial for any deployment on Spheron. All token values passed in ICL or CLI must have the correct precision. For details on token precision, refer to the [Supported Payment Token](/user-guide/supports#supported-payment-tokens) section.
</Callout>


### Checking your Account Balance
Check your account has sufficient balance by running:

```sh
sphnctl payment balance --token [Token Name]
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
This is your current balance for this token [Token Name]:
 Total: 443064994100000000

Deposited USDT balance
 Unlocked: 22929459
 Locked: 4164    
```

### Listing All the Payment Tokens
To find all the payment tokens that are registered in Spheron Protocol, you need to run this command to fetch them:

```sh
sphnctl payment tokens
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Available tokens:
Denom: SPH, Precision: 18, TokenAddress: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000
Denom: USDT, Precision: 6, TokenAddress: 0x24A05B480235Ccb450bf7Ce7e9F65072Ed732292
```

## Create your Configuration

Create a deployment configuration **gpu.yaml** to deploy the `jupyter/minimal-notebook` for Jupyter Notebook container using ICL.


You may use the sample deployment file as-is or modify it for your own needs as described in our ICL **(Infrastructure Composition Language)** documentation. A typical modification would be to reference your own image instead of our image.

EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION:

```sh
cat > gpu.yml <<EOF
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  web:
    image: jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest
    expose:
      - port: 8888
        as: 8888
        to:
          - global: true
    env:
      - TEST=test

      count: 1
      
EOF
```

## Deployment Overview

### Create your Deployment
To deploy on Spheron, run:

```sh
sphnctl deployment create deploy.yml --duration [Duration of running]
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Checking ballance for wallet: 0x2c11A76298A111B8cA8Db82205dc8f0A2688e6e8
Validating SDL configuration.
SDL validated.
Sending configuration for provider matching.
Waiting for providers to bid on the deployment order...
Bid found.
Order matched successfully.
Deployment created using wallet 0x2c11A76298A111B8cA8Db82205dc8f0A2688e6e8
 lid: 44
 provider: 0x6634d41cccBD1E1576Ed4c6226832521A66bF874
 agreed price: 158747943694
Sending the manifest for deployment…
Deployment manifest sent, waiting for acknowledgment.
Deployment is finished.
```

The `lid` that we get from the deployment is called Lease ID. This is the identifier that you need to use to access your deployment’s logs, and status. During the deployment you also pass duration to run the deployment which will be in 1s, 1min, 1h, 1d, 1mon, & 1y. This will specify how much time the lease need to run and accordingly lock funds to continue to run the deployment. When you close the deployment prematurely, then you will unlock the amount that has not been spent.

### Fetch Deployment Details
To fetch your deployment / lease details, you need to run this command to fetch it:

This will contain URL to access the deployment server, all the assigned ports and the URI to access it. With this you can check your deployment status.

```sh
sphnctl deployment get --lid [Lease ID] 
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Here is the status of the Lease ID: 101
Services running:
  web
    URL: []
    Ports:
      - provider.provider.devnetasphn.com:8888 -> 42100 (TCP)
    Replicas: 1/1 available, 1 ready
    Host URI: provider.devnetasphn.com
    Region: us-east
    IPs: []
```

### Fetch Deployment Logs
To fetch your deployment's logs, you need to run this command to fetch it:

```sh
sphnctl deployment logs --lid [Lease ID]
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```
Here is the logs for the Lease ID: 101
