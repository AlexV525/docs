# Members and Roles

You can navigate to **Team** from the navbar to view the members of your organization. Spheron allows you to assign roles to these members. Roles are a set of permissions that defines the actions a user can perform in an organization. \
You can choose from the following three roles:

- **Owner**: Full access
- **Admin**: Can manage billing and domains along with all the member access
- **Member**: Only has view access and can deploy projects

<Callout type="info">
  **NOTE:** Only Owners and Admins can assign roles and invite members to join
  the organization.
</Callout>

## Invite Members

To invite members to your organization:

1. Navigate to **Team** from the navbar.
2. Click on "Add Members" in the **Pending Invites** section.
3. Enter the email address of members separated by commas (without spaces) and Click "Send."

These members will receive an invitation email from Spheron.
All members are assigned a member role when they first join the organization. You can then assign them different roles.
