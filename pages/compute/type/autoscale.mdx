# Autoscale

Spheron offers Autoscale compute type that dynamically adjusts the allocation of computational resources based on real-time changes
in application demands. This automated process allows the system to seamlessly scale resources up or down to match varying workloads,
ensuring optimal performance and efficient resource utilization. By continuously monitoring key performance metrics, Autoscale
ensures that the right amount of resources is provisioned at any given time, minimizing underutilization during low demand and
preventing performance bottlenecks during peak usage.
