# Regions & Routing

## Regionsâ€‹
The Spheron Edge Network delivers content through its CDN from servers in the nearest region. That will increase the app performance of all its customers. It is critical for businesses that span across the globe.

### Outage Resilience
An app's traffic will be rerouted to another edge region if an edge region goes down. Even if all the regions go down, you can still access your deployments from the origin (IPFS or Arweave).

## Routing
Spheron acts as an overlay network on top of decentralized networks enabling faster connections and increased performance. Our network is currently limited to two regions. Once we have more traffic, we will expand to more regions.

| Region ID | Reference Location | Provider Region    |

| ohi1      | Ohio, USA          | AWS us-east-2      |
| syd1      | Sydney, Australia  | AWS ap-southeast-2 |
