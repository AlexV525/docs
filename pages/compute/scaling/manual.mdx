# Manual Scaling

Spheron offers Manual Scaling to adjust the computational resources allocated to an instance. The users can make decisions
to increase or decrease the allocated resources, such as CPU, memory, or storage, to meet changing performance requirements.
This type of scaling provides users with direct control over resource adjustments, allowing for optimization based
on specific workload characteristics and immediate operational needs.

[Please schedule a team call](https://meetings.hubspot.com/prashant-maurya/scaling-demo) to gain early access to Manual Scaling.
