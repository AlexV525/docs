# No Scaling

Spheron offers No Scaling in which the allocation of computational resources remains static and fixed.
In this configuration, resource allocation remains unchanged irrespective of workload fluctuations or application demands.
This approach is straightforward and doesn't involve complex configurations.

## How to use No Scaling?

### With Docker

To use no scaling with a custom Docker image on Spheron:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Import from Docker Hub**.
3. Enter the names for your cluster and docker image.
4. Then, Add the tag and Click "Next".
5. Select "No Scaling" under Scaling.
6. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in a region suitable for that instance. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
7. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
8. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
9. Create new **Port Policy Mapping**. Add the container port, and Select the exposed port you want to map it to. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#port-mapping) to know more.
10. Add **Environment Variable**, if any.
11. Add **Secret Environment Variable** if the value is a secret key. It will not be saved in the database. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#environment-variables) to know more.
12. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#advanced-configuration) to know more.
13. You can add health checkup if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#health-checkup) to know more.
14. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

### With Marketplace App

To use no scaling with a marketplace app on Spheron:

1. Click "New Cluster" on the top right corner.
2. Select **Start from marketplace app**.
3. Pick your desired template from the marketplace.
4. Select "No Scaling" under **Scaling**.
5. Select your preferred **Region**, if any. If you do not add a region, the container will be deployed in a region suitable for that instance. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#region) to know more.
6. Select the instance plan that suits your needs. Use the "Create Custom Plan" toggle to create custom plans for your instance.
7. Configure Storage (SSD) plan for your instance. Use the "Add Persistent Storage" toggle to add persistent storage for your instance.
8. You can add advanced configuration if required. [Click here](/compute/cluster/#additional-configuration-1) to know more.
9. Click "Deploy" to initiate deployment.

## Limitations

- **Limited Flexibility:** The absence of scaling and a direct SLA tied to the Akash network rather than Spheron limits the ability to efficiently manage fluctuating workloads or unexpected spikes in usage.
- **Inefficient Resource Usage:** Resources remain static regardless of workload fluctuations, potentially leading to underutilization during periods of low demand or resource shortages during peak times.
- **Limited Availability:** If there are unforeseen events or sudden changes in demand, the lack of automated scaling can lead to service disruptions and performance issues.
