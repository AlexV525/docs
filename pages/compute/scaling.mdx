# Compute Scaling

## What is compute scaling?

Compute Scaling is the ability to adjust the computational resources allocated to an instance,
aiming to optimize performance and resource utilization.

We offer the following three types of scaling:

## No Scaling

### Pros

- Setting up an instance with no scaling is straightforward and doesn't involve complex configurations.
- Decentralized deployment of resources occurs across a diverse set of Akash providers, and is not just limited to our own providers.

### Cons

- Handling unexpected spikes in traffic can be problematic as there is no mechanism to handle the increased load.

## Manual Scaling

### Pros

- Capability to adjust the allocated resources to align with changing demands.
- Ability to increase or decrease the number of instance replicas as needed, providing more flexibility in handling varying workloads.

### Cons

- Requires user intervention to scale resources. It does not adapt automatically based on demand fluctuations.

## Auto Scaling

### Pros

- Enables the instance to automatically adjust resources based on demand fluctuations, ensuring optimal performance and efficient resource utilization.
