# Spheron Edge Network
The Spheron Edge Network delivers content through its CDN from the edge, i.e., from servers closest to the user. 

### CDN (Content Delivery Network)
CDN refers to a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to accelerate connections. It allows quick transfer of assets that minimizes loading time and increases performance.

### Edge Computing
Edge computing brings servers closer to you to optimize internet services. That minimizes the need for long-distance communications between the user and the server, which reduces latency and bandwidth usage.
