# Organization

An organization represents a group of people with shared ownership of projects.
Spheron lets you create multiple organizations, each operating globally across all our services.

- **Settings and Members:** The settings and members remain consistent across all services within the organization. When you invite a member, they gain visibility into all services associated with the organization.

- **Ownership and Admins:** Every organization has a single owner - who has created it. Others can be promoted to admin status within the organization, creating a well-structured management hierarchy.

## Create an Organization

Follow these steps to create an organization:

1. If you are a new user, you will see the **Create an Organization** section as soon as you sign in.
2. Select "Create an Organization" from the organization dropdown to create a new organization.
